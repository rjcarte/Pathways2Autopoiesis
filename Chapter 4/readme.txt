IMPORTANT NOTE

It is recommended that MATLAB r2016b is used to run the simulation scripts.

PURPOSE

The code and data is supplied as supplementary material to the paper "Emergence and dynamics of self-producing information niches as a step towards pre-evolutionary organization" by R.J.Carter, K.Wiesner, S.Mann Â© 2017

GENERAL

This supplementary information is available for referees and other interested parties who wish to run the MATLAB simulation code to reproduce the results described in the above paper.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPRODUCING RESULTS FROM SECTION 3.1

To reproduce the results described in section 3.1 and shown in figure 1 six (6) MATLAB scripts are available in the ./code/section3-1 folder, as follows (the filenames are self-explanatory): 

nicheA_fig1a.m
nicheB_fig1b.m
nicheC_fig1c.m
nicheD_fig1d.m
nicheE_fig1e.m
nicheF_fig1f.m

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPRODUCING RESULTS FROM SECTION 3.2

To reproduce the results described in section 3.2 and shown in figure 4, four (4) MATLAB scripts are available in the ./code/section3-2 folder, as follows (the filenames are self-explanatory): 

nicheAperturbed_fig4a.m
