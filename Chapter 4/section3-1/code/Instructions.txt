IMPORTANT NOTE

It is recommended that MATLAB r2016b is used to run the simulation scripts.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPRODUCING RESULTS FROM SECTION 3.1

A MATLAB script is provided for each of the simulations described in section 3.1 of the paper ‘Emergence and dynamics of self-producing information niches as a step towards pre-evolutionary organization’. Each script runs the simulation in MATLAB, tracks changes in the structure of the population of interacting automatons, and present the results as a plot. The plots generated should be similar to those shown in figure 1 of the paper.

EXECUTION TIME

The simulations are run over a large number of iterations from 1e6 to 1e7 and this, along with other factors (e.g. where diffusive mixing is occurring), will increase the execution time of the simulation. As a guide the simulations can take 0.5 - 2 hrs to complete (this is baselined against the code running on a 2016 Intel i7 quad-core CPU with 16GB RAM).

Six MATLAB scripts are provided:

nicheA_fig1a.m
nicheB_fig1b.m
nicheC_fig1c.m
nicheD_fig1d.m
nicheE_fig1e.m
nicheF_fig1f.m

To run a script:

1.	Open the file in Matlab (e.g. ‘nicheA_fig1a.m’)
2.	If required, change the working directory for MATLAB to the directory that has the MATLAB script in e.g. ./section3-1/code/
3.	Run the script
4.	The script will now run the simulation code using the correct environment parameters to generate a plot which should be similar to the associated figure in the paper.
